## Introduction
Events Hub was created with the purpose of assisting event organizers in efficiently managing their events and tracking customer interest. The web application allows organizers to create events, track attendance, and reduce security costs by limiting access to registered attendees only. As the sole member of the project, I took on multiple roles, including front-end and back-end development, as well as project management. With a focus on creating a user-friendly interface and seamless event management process, I embarked on this journey to bring Events Hub to life.

### Key Features and Results:
Event Creation: One of the key features of Events Hub is its ability to allow event organizers to easily create and set up events. Organizers can input all the necessary details such as event name, date, location, and other relevant information. This feature streamlines the event creation process, saving organizers time and effort.

Event Reservation: Events Hub provides a seamless reservation system, allowing potential attendees to register their interest in attending specific events. This feature enables organizers to track attendee interest and manage event capacity effectively. Attendees can reserve their spots and receive confirmations, ensuring a smooth and organized event experience.

Event Review: Another important feature of Events Hub is the capability for event organizers and attendees to leave reviews and feedback after the event. This allows for valuable insights and recommendations to be shared, helping organizers improve future events and providing attendees with a platform to share their experiences.
